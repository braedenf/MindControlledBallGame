MindControlledBallGame
======================

This game is used to test the believability of mind controlled interaction.
In this instance, the player is asked to focus on a particular thought and hold it in order to levitate the ball 
to the top of the screen. When the ball hits the top of the screen, the ball resets and the level adds 1 and the
attetion threshold adds 10% to each level making it harder to levitate the ball. 

I'm interested to see if players think that they actually have any control over th ball with ther'e mind.
